# Contributing

Use CRuby 3.3 or later. Run `bundle install`, then `bundle exec rake`, `bundle exec rubocop` and `bundle exec rake build`. Run `COVERAGE=1 bundle exec rspec` to check line coverage. Socket-related changes must pass the real gRPC integration tests on Linux.

Write a failing behavior test before changing nontrivial logic. Keep commits focused. Public API comments use YARD's `@api public` tag. Avoid loading optional testing libraries in production.

Update CHANGELOG only for user-visible behavior. Documentation, internal tooling and tests alone do not justify a release. First release notes are exactly `Initial release.`. See [release instructions](docs/guides/releasing.md).

## Repositories

[gritz-core](https://github.com/gritzrpc/gritz-core) owns routing, controllers, middleware, configuration and network-free testing without a grpc dependency. [gritz-native](https://github.com/gritzrpc/gritz-native) owns the official grpc gem adapter and real-socket tests. [gritz](https://github.com/gritzrpc/gritz) combines them, provides the executable and contains the hello example.

Each repository has its own Gemfile, gemspec, tests, CI and release workflow. Keep application behavior in the core and wire-protocol details in the adapter.

## Local component changes

Development uses the components' `main` branches. To work on local checkouts, use Bundler's [local Git overrides](https://guides.rubygems.org/git/#local-git-repos):

```sh
bundle config set --local local.gritz-core ../gritz-core
bundle install
```

Each local component must be on `main`. These overrides live in ignored `.bundle/config`; sibling checkouts are optional. Push component commits before pushing a dependent repository. To return to remote dependencies:

```sh
bundle config unset --local local.gritz-core
bundle update gritz-core
```
